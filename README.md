# Initiation of the repo

This repo contains the vimrc, the pathogen plugin manager and some plugins like vimtex and Nvim-R.

These plugins are included as submodules. So in order to initiate the vim environment I have to download all of them. 

```

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/savvas-paragkamian/.vim.git

```
